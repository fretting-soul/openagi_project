## Introduction

Provide a concise overview of your backend project. Describe its purpose, architecture, and key components. Mention any technologies or frameworks used, as well as the target audience for the project.

## Features

- Highlight the key features of your frontend application. Use bullet points to list them and provide brief descriptions or examples if necessary.

- Authentication and Authorization: Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to resources and endpoints.

- API Endpoints: Define RESTful API endpoints to handle client requests and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data.

- Database Integration: Integrate with a database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB) to store and retrieve application data.

- Data Validation and Sanitization: Validate and sanitize user input to prevent security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

- Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle exceptions and return meaningful error responses to clients.

# Additional Notes
If any dependency installation or setup step encounters an error, ensure that your system meets the prerequisites and try running the command again.

For development purposes, you can run the application in watch mode to automatically reload the page when changes are made to the source code. Use the command npm run start:dev or npm run dev if such a script is configured in the package.json file.
